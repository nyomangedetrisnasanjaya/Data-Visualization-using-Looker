#### Title: Trend of the Number of Trips VS the Average Duration in Minute of 2017-2018

This project delves into the trends of the number of trips and their corresponding average durations in minutes, spanning the years 2017 to 2018. Leveraging dummy data sourced from the RevoU Mini Course, it offers insights into user behavior and preferences within the specified time frame.

The output of this endeavor is a dynamic dashboard hosted on my Looker Report. It provides an analysis of the number of trips, average duration in minutes, and tailored strategies for both subscribers and customers. Stakeholders can explore and derive actionable insights from this interactive platform, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
